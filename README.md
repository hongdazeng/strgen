StrGen
======



This set of simple java programs will generate strings based on user requests.

    Strgen is the first version of this program and it is also the most basic.
    
    -It produce a string based on the length the user asked for and a specific pickline.  A pickline is the list of characters   
    that the program will pick from in order to generate the random string.  The most basic method of this program will pick from 
    0~9 then a~z (lower case).  The most advanced method will allow the users to chose their own pickline, allowing for more 
    customized and more unique outputs.
    
    
    StrgenTwo is the second version of this program.  It will be simplified down and be more effcient.
